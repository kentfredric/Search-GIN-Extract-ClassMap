NAME
    Search::GIN::Extract::ClassMap - Delegate Extraction based on class.

VERSION
    version 0.01001206

SYNOPSIS
      my $extractor = Search::GIN::Extract::ClassMap->new(
        extract_isa => {
          'Foo' => [qw( bar baz quux )],
          'Bar' => Search::GIN::Extract::AttributeIndex->new(),
          'Baz' => sub { shift; my $object = shift; { a => $object->a() } },
        },
        extract_does => {

        },
        extract =>  {
          /* either ISA or DOES */
        },
      );

    In reality, the form is more like this:

      my $extractor = Search::GIN::Extract::ClassMap->new(
        extract_isa => {
          'Foo' => Search::GIN::Extract::*,
          'Bar' => Search::GIN::Extract::*,
          'Baz' => Search::GIN::Extract::*,
        },
        extract_does => {

        },
        extract =>  {
          /* either ISA or DOES */
        },
      );

    With the minor exception of the 2 exception cases, passing an array ref,
    or a coderef, which internally are typecasted to
    Search::GIN::Extract::Attributes and Search::GIN::Extract::Callback
    automatically.

WARNING
    This is an early release, API is prone to change without much warning,
    but best attempts will be made to avoid the need.

ROLES
  Search::GIN::Extract
ATTRIBUTES
  extract_isa
    Applied on all objects where $object->isa( $classname );

   types:
   HashRef[ "Extractor" in Search::GIN::Extract::ClassMap::Types ] ->
   "CoercedClassMap" in Search::GIN::Extract::ClassMap::Types ->
   Search::GIN::Extract::ClassMap::Isa
    HashRef's are automatically type-cast.

  extract_does
    Applied on all objects where $object->does( $classname );

   types:
   HashRef[ "Extractor" in Search::GIN::Extract::ClassMap::Types ] ->
   "CoercedClassMap" in Search::GIN::Extract::ClassMap::Types ->
   Search::GIN::Extract::ClassMap::Does
    HashRef's are automatically type-cast.

  extract_does
    Applied on all objects where $object->does( $classname ) OR
    $object->isa( $classname );

    this doesn't make complete sense, but its handy for lazy people.

   types:
   HashRef[ "Extractor" in Search::GIN::Extract::ClassMap::Types ]
   "CoercedClassMap" in Search::GIN::Extract::ClassMap::Types ->
