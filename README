Search::GIN::Extract::ClassMap

This module is an extension for the "Search::GIN" framework providing a
novel way to dictate which attribute extraction techniques will be used
for which object by having rules that map against the objects
inheritance or the objects composed roles.

This essentially permits you to register adapters for various object
types to special-case their extraction.

For example, if you had a source tree that used classes under your
control using "MooseX::AttributeIndexes", you could easily default those
classes to extract using "Search::GIN::Extract::AttributeIndexes". And
if any objects of those classes had "DateTime" properties, you could
define a handler for extracting "DateTime" meta-data for indexing
specifically.
